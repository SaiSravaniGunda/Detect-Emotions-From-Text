# Emotion Detection API 🎭

This is a FastAPI-powered backend that uses a fine-tuned DistilBERT model to detect emotions from text. It supports multi-label classification with 28 emotion categories, based on the GoEmotions dataset from Google.

## 🔥 Features

- Trained on the [GoEmotions dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/go_emotions)
- Fine-tuned DistilBERT model using PyTorch
- REST API with `/predict` endpoint
- Docker-free Render deployment ready
- Lightweight and fast response using sigmoid activations


## 🚀 Getting Started (Locally)

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-api.git
cd emotion-api
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the API

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The server will start on: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## 🔌 API Usage

### `POST /predict`

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "text": "I am so happy and grateful today!"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "text": "I am feeling very happy and excited today!",
  "emotions": {
    "joy": "75%",
    "excitement": "60%",
    "love": "32%"
  }
}

```

You can map these indices using the `label_mapping.json` you saved during training.
